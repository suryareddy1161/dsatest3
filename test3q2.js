/* Q2) Given two strings S and P. Find the smallest window in the string S consisting of all the characters(including duplicates) of the string P.  Return "-1" in case there is no such window present. In case there are multiple such windows of same length, return the one with the least starting index. 
Example 1:
Input:
S = "timetopractice"
P = "toc"
Output: 
toprac
Explanation: "toprac" is the smallest
substring in which "toc" can be found.

Example 2:
Input:
S = "zoomlazapzo"
P = "oza"
Output: 
apzo
